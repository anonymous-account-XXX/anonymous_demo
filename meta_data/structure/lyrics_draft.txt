Morning sun, golden light, Packed my bag, feeling right, Hit the road, sky so blue, Every turn, something new, With each step, dreams ignite, Journey of joy, pure delight. Smiling wide, heart so free, In the rhythm, just like me, Where dreams and joy agree. Met a girl, bright and kind, Shared a laugh, left worries behind, Through the fields, hand in hand, Found our place, in this land, Every moment, felt so true, Journey of joy, me and you. Smiling wide, heart so free, In the rhythm, just like me, Where dreams and joy agree.
